## Asking Questions

1. Search first as your question might already be answered. If so, you'll get your answer faster by searching than by posting.

    a. Search the [online fourm][online-forum]. You do not need an account to search and read the forum.
    
    b. [Search Stack Overflow][stackoverflow-read] using the tag `treode`.
    
    c. Search using your favorite search engine.

2. If you haven't found an answer, post the question.

    a. Ask in the [online fourm][online-forum]. You can use your GitHub account to login; click the "Log In" button. Or you create an account specifically for the forum if that's your preference.

    b. [Ask on Stack Overflow][stackoverflow-ask] using the tag `treode`. Remember to keep your question oriented towards [specific programming problems that have an answer][stackoverflow-howto].



## Reporting Bugs

A bug should be straighforward and not discursive.  For anything that might require discussion, use the [online forum][online-forum].

1. Update to the latest release; the bug may be resolved.

2. Search the [online forum][online-forum] and [issue database][issues]; there may already be hints or workarounds.

3. Report the bug. We are flexible about where you report it.

    a. Raise the issue in the [online fourm][online-forum]. This is the most informal and flexible method.
    
    b. [File an issue][new-issue]. Please state clearly what you did, what actually happened, and what you had expected to happen. If you suspect the problem warrants discussion, consider using the [online forum][online-forum] rather than the issue database.
    
    c. Submit a [pull request](#pull-request) with a failing test case; you do not need to create an issue first.
    
    d. Submit a [pull request](#pull-request) with a test case and fix; you do not need to create an issue first.



## Requesting Features

Request new features through the [online fourm][online-forum]. Feature requests posted to the issue database will be politely closed. Search there first as there may already be a discussion, development or other activity related to your request.

The online forum provides everyone a chance to discuss the a request until we clearly understand the functionality, its relevance to general users, and possible implementations.


## Submitting a Pull Request
<a name="pull-request"></a>

You can submit changes the GitHub way: by [submitting a pull request][using-pull-requests]. We deviate from the usual GitHub workflow at the end: we may [cleanup the pull request][merge-harmful] before merging it.

To formulate a change list, you'll want to know more about building Treode and running tests. You can find that information in the [Contributor category of the online forum][online-forum-contributor]. Of course, the online forum is also a great place to raise design considerations.
